                Achieving a higher level of return is, of course, easy if it means accepting higher risk.
                One simply uses leverage, thus amplifying both risk and reward.<br/><br/>

                But our methods generally do the exact opposite. They deliver above-average returns
                at a below average risk and without any form of leverage- an absolute rarity.

                One of the best and most modern risk/reward benchmarks,
                is the Omega function, the output of which, is depicted on the left.<br/><br/>

                Higher levels indicate higher returns,
                and steeper slopes indicate lower risk.
                The yearly return distribution is significantly superior to DJIA at all tresholds
                and for all products. Depicted: Yearly Omega Function
