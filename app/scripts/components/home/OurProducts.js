          We offer four products, each of which gives you access to a secure dashboard.
          You will be able to track our model portfolio, access our purchase and
          sales transactions in real-time as they occur,
          and obtain valuable information about stocks selected for purchase or sale.<br/><br/>


          You can choose to use this information to buy stocks through your regular broker/bank,
          either by using our selections on an ongoing basis, or by mirroring the model portfolio
          and keeping abreast of changes as they regularly occur.<br/><br/>

          Once you have made your purchases, you simply wait. Later,
          a sales recommendation will suggest when to sell the stock.
          The average holding period is 2.2 years.
