          We offer 4 products, each of which gives you access to a secure dashboard.
          This contains purchase recommendations for common stocks updated weekly,
          sales recommendations, a model portfolio and advanced information about recommended stocks.<br/><br/>

          You can choose to use this information to buy stocks through your regular broker/bank,
          either by using recommendations on a regular basis, or by mirroring the model portfolio.<br/><br/>

          Once purchased, you simply wait. Later, a sales recommendation will suggest you to sell the stock.
          The average holding period is 2.2 years.
